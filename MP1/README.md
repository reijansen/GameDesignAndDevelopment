Machine Problem 1 (MP1) - Plane Flying Game

Overview

This repository contains my solution to Machine Problem 1 (MP1) for CMSC 197: Game Development and Design at the University of the Philippines Visayas. The task involved fixing and enhancing a Plane Flying game using Unity.

Project Description

The objective of this project was to modify and improve an existing Unity project by implementing specific movement controls, camera mechanics, and obstacles. The base project was provided through the "Create with Code" tutorial from Unity.

Features Implemented

1. Camera System
- Positioned the camera behind the plane to follow its movement.
- The camera rotates and moves along with the plane, mimicking a driving simulator.

2. Plane Controls
- Implemented movement controls based on three axes:
  - **Pitch** - Tilts the plane up and down.
  - **Roll** - Tilts the plane left to right.
  - **Yaw** - Swivels the plane left to right.
- Used Unity's Input Manager to map different axes to achieve smooth and responsive controls.

3. Additional Obstacles
- Created new obstacles to enhance gameplay, including:
  - A moving obstacle that challenges the playerâ€™s navigation skills.
  - A rotating obstacle that requires precise maneuvering.
  - A combination of both to increase difficulty and engagement.

How to Run the Project

1. Download and import the Unity package from this repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Press `Play` to test the Plane Flying game.
4. Use the movement controls to navigate the plane through obstacles.
